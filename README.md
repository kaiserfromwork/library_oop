This is a simplified library management system built as a practical exercise in object-oriented programming (OOP) and JSON file manipulation. It features User and Book classes, and a Library class that simulates database interactions using JSON files. The project's primary goal was to solidify understanding of OOP principles and file I/O with JSON. I was able to implement aspects Dependency Injection, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.
