########################################## IMPLEMENTING/LAST WORKING ON ##########################################


##################### Challenges Faced and Solutions I found during the Project #####################
- Storing the data in a database.json file:
    - (writing and reading to JSON file using a list is a lot easier to manipulate and deal with of the data)
- having functions that read, write and update database in inside database class and having library class storing, appending, updating user information to a list and using it to update database***** might change this******
- using a function (getter) to get value of protected variable/attribute
